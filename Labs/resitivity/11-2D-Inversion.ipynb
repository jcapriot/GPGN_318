    "In this lab you will run the notebook apps from [this notebook](DC_2D_Inversion.ipynb) that will setup and run an inversion for you. It will walk you through many of the steps to doing an inversion and interpreting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the steps are:\n",
    "1) Load your data  \n",
    "    The application expects you to give the A, B, M, and N, locations in 2D (x,z) and also supply the apparent resistivity. The inversion notebook is preset to load in one of your collected data sets as an example of how to start up the inversion procedure.\n",
    "2) Plot your data\n",
    "3) Set up a mesh  \n",
    "    Designing a proper mesh is its own challenge. It is a balance of discretizing the mesh to be small enough to accurately model the physics (through numerical techniques) vs having a small total number of mesh cells (the more mesh cells the larger the memory requirements, the longer the inversion takes to run).\n",
    "4) Set uncertainties  \n",
    "   While the recorded data have their own set of noise analysis, those do not often catch all sources of noise in the data, thus it is common to set a percentage noise level for DC inversion.\n",
    "5) Run the inversion  \n",
    "   There are several options you can set here to influence the recovered model. There is a reference model, an initial model, parameters to control smoothness, etc.\n",
    "6) Explore the results  \n",
    "   You can investigate the recovered model for each iteration of the inversion here, usually we want to choose one towards the end that fits our data to our prescribed noise level.\n",
    "7) Run a sensitivity analysis  \n",
    "   There are areas of our model that are more controlled by the data, and areas that are more controlled by the reference model. Our goal is to highlight the data controlled areas. One method of doing this is to use a Depth of Investigation index. The general idea behind this process is to invert your data twice with different reference models. Where the inversion results agree with each other, the recovered model can be interpreted as being controlled by the data. Where the results disagree, they are more controlled by the reference model.\n",
    "8) Plot the model within a given sensitivity.  \n",
    "   This tool allows you to choose a DOI level and only plot model values above that cutoff line.\n"
