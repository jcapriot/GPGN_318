    "# Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is designed to give you an understanding of how errors and noise effect the data we collect.\n",
    "As such you will collect many repeated measurements using geophysical equipment. The system we will use to explore this is a Self-Potential measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Should be enough equipment for 10 groups (of 2 people)\n",
    "* Each group should:\n",
    "    * Choose a single reference location\n",
    "    * Choose 5 (or more) sample locations\n",
    "    * Take as many measurements at each location as possible (aim for at least 10)\n",
    "    * Choose any order you like to take the measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Self-Potential (SP)\n",
    "We will discuss this more later, but fundamentally there are spurious and naturally occuring electrical currents running throughout the earth, these currents can be measured by looking at the electrical potential at locations on the surface. The units of electrical potential are volts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring SP\n",
    "Probably the simplest geophysical setup\n",
    "* Plant one electrode in the ground\n",
    "* Attach a wire to it\n",
    "* Plant another electrode in the ground\n",
    "* Attach a wire to it\n",
    "* Measure the DC voltage between the two electrodes with a Multimeter\n",
    "    * Connect the COM/ground/black socket to the reference electrode.\n",
    "    * Connect the Red/Voltage socket to the roving electrode.\n",
    "    * The instrument will tell you $\\Delta V = V_{red} - V_{black}$ (so you could switch the two probes and negate the number in your head)\n",
    "* Record the value in your notebook"
